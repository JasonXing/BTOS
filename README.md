# BTOS

This BTOS-ISO is a daemon which can be used in demonstrating what we're going to implement or in very quick and easy-to-install circumstances.

We only click "install", the operating system will move on without any movement that you make. After installation, you only choose reboot to restart your computer to finish installing.

Enjoy BTOS...
